## 🚀 What is this?

This project is an experimental **Conversational Driven User Interface (CDUI)** that replaces traditional website navigation with a **conversation-powered UI runtime**.

Instead of clicking menus, links, or navigating through predefined pages, users explore the system by **talking to it**. The interface is dynamically generated based on user intent and context — each screen exists only because the user asked for it.

There is **no navbar**, no sitemap, and no static page structure.  
The UI emerges from the conversation itself.

## 🧠 CDUI — Conversational Driven User Interface

> CDUI is a new UX paradigm where the UI is *not predesigned* — it is **constructed in real time** from user intent.

### Core principles

- **Conversation replaces navigation**
- **UI is data, not markup**
- **AI describes screens — runtime renders them**
- **User intent dictates the interface**
- **Clarification over guessing** (the system asks when ambiguous)

### CDUI vs. traditional web UX

| Traditional Website | CDUI Runtime |
|--------------------|-------------|
| User adapts to the interface | Interface adapts to the user |
| Static pages and routes | No routes — conversational states |
| Navigation bar, sitemap, prebuilt layout | Nothing until requested |
| Hierarchy and menus | Intent-driven rendering |
| Predesigned UX flows | Responsive and emergent interaction |

## 🏗️ Why even bother?

Web navigation has barely evolved since the 1990s. Despite advances in computing, we still force users to:

- locate information manually  
- understand page hierarchies  
- follow rigid paths designed by someone else  

This is a **legacy constraint**, not a natural law.

Information systems should adapt to humans — **not the other way around**.

There is a growing necessity to **disrupt traditional webpage layout patterns** and reconsider the role of UI entirely. Instead of a fixed structure waiting to be discovered, the interface can be:

- **summoned** when needed  
- **shaped** by context  
- **negotiated** through language  
- **dynamic**, not static

The **CDUI runtime** explores this shift:

- away from menus, navbars, and routing
- toward **intent → interpretation → interface**

It treats the UI as a **living, conversational entity** rather than a static destination.

## 📌 Current Roadmap (MVP)

- [ ] React + TypeScript scaffold
- [ ] CDUI screen schema (`ScreenDescription`, `Widget`, `Action`)
- [ ] Renderer that materializes screens from JSON
- [ ] Chat panel with message memory
- [ ] Screen history (home/back)
- [ ] Clarification logic on ambiguous user intent
- [ ] Portfolio dataset (projects, tech stacks, experience)
- [ ] Polished example flows demonstrating concept

---

## 🛠️ Planned Tech Stack

- **React + TypeScript**
- **Vite** development environment
- **Custom CDUI Runtime**
- Mock AI → later real LLM integration

Optional later:

- Voice input/output
- Avatar with conversational states
- Electron/Tauri shell
- Advanced widgets (timeline, skill matrix, relationship graph)

## 👁️ Final Note

This is not a website.

It is a **prototype of a post-navigation world**, where interfaces no longer need menus, routes, or predesigned paths. It challenges the assumption that users should learn how to use software — instead, software should learn how to respond to users.

**CDUI is a step toward interfaces that shape themselves around conversation.**

Stay tuned.
